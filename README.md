# Vending-machine
A course work of Lab5 in NTHU Hardware Design and Lab.

Lab5 is a group project, the other one is Music_fpga.v,
but it is implemented by my teammate so I didn't include it in this repository.

In this group project I implement the design of a vending machine using Verilog that 
runs on FPGA BASYS3.

The Ip directory is borrowed from Sample code provided on course.
