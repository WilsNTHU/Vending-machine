# Vending-machine
A course work of Lab5 in NTHU Hardware Design and Lab.

This Verilog code simulate the behaviour of a vending machine using an Xilinx BASYS3 FPGA board.

The .xdc file is the constraint file which can be used in Vivado when creating new project,
it defines the relevent infomration to the I/O ports.

The Ip directory is borrowed from Sample code provided on course.
